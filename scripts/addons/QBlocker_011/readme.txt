QBlocker 0.1

Just a quick readme, sorry!!  I will rewrite it later, but too many people asked to share my addon, and i can't resist:)

Version 0.1
Create Cube, Cylinder and Sphere objects with this interactive tool!
- Right and Left click support.
- Start with different methods like define corners, or center for you object.
- Set segments on the fly with mousescroll or keyhold for pen users.
- While creating the object, you can use the custom snap features like:
	vertex, edge division snap(yep, midpoint too) or oriented snap point grid.
- Set the object origin to centered or ground to put object on surfaces.

You can find the tool:
View3D-> Add-> QBlocker
Alt+X -> QBlocker
Context menu in object mode -> QBlocker(If the context menu is on the active mouse button )

Thank you! Hope it will help you a lot in your work!
